rutgers-repository-utils
========================
Utility scripts for managing Rutgers repositories.

Sources
-------
`repoclosure` is from yum-utils, and does dependency checking on yum
repositories.

`genpkgmetadata`, `mergerepo`, `modifyrepo`, and `worker` are all from
createrepo, which does some other repository business.
